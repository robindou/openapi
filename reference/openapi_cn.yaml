      开发Trip.com API之前，您需要完成两件事。首先您需要向您的Trip.com商务经理申请Alliance ID，Site ID 和 Proxy Key，其次你需要配置接口认证服务。我们采用了类似于Oauth2.0的认证方式，首先您需要初始化一个访问令牌Access Token，其次在访问令牌快过期时通过Refreshing Token更新访问令牌。

        This API is used to generate a new access token and a new refreshing token. The new access token is used to request each API, while the new refresh token is used to generate a new pair of access token and refreshing token for the next time. We suggest you generate a new pair of access token and refreshing token `1 minute `before the current access token expires.

        After a new pair of access token and refreshing token is generated, replace the old pair of access token and refreshing token which you have stored locally with the new pair. To help you better transfer from old access token to new access token, we won't fail your requests which are still using the old access token within `1 minute` after new access token is generated. However, you `MUST` use the new access token to access each API after having it stored locally.

                    It defines how to get room static content by page navigation.

                    #### Why you might need it?
                    For some hotels, we have much more suppliers than what you could believe. This has led our system to create many sellable room ids. When a hotel has too many sellable room ids (let's say thousands of ids), our API will respond you much slowly, sometime even timed out. For these hotels, we provide an optimized way to get sellable room ids in different batches.
                    When you meet these hotels which time out frequently, you could trigger page navation to download their static content.

                    Notice: Requesting `HotelID` alone supports page navigation. Requesting `HotelID` together with either `RoomIDs` or `RoomTypeIDs` doesn't support page navigation.

                      type: string
                      description: |-
                        It's the page cursor/index used to identify where you are while you are downloading all physical and sellable rooms of the same hotel.
                        + If it's the first attempt to download all physical rooms and sellable rooms of `the same hotel`, pass in `null` value.
                        + If it isn't the first attempt to download all physical rooms and sellable rooms of `the same hotel`, pass in value of parameter `LastRecordID` in the response of previous request.

                              ##### For `pay-at-hotel` room, there's no `settlement price` at all, and it only has `retail price`. If a `pay-at-hotel` room needs guarantee, you could use total guarantee amount within the array directly. You could also calculate total guarantee amount based on parameter `GuaranteeCode` within the array.

                              ##### If we only offer you `retail price` for `pay-in-advance` room, you could also use total guarantee amount within the array directly. When a confirmed reservation proves noshow, guarantee amount will be deducted as penalty.

                              ##### If we offer you `settlement price` for `pay-in-advance` room, you could ONLY calculate total guarantee amount based on parameter `GuaranteeCode` within the array. When a confirmed reservation proves noshow, guarantee amount will be deducted as penalty.

                                            ##### Why credit cards need to support pre-authorization? For reservations made on pay-at-hotel rooms which should be guaranteed with certain amount, we need to freeze or deduct guarantee amount from guests' credit cards. If freezing or deduction fails, reservation fails too.

                                      `Ctrip` means we are authorized. In this case, ignore sibling array `CreditCard`. Instead, we suggest you restrict card issuers to be either of **MasterCard, Visa, JCB, American Express, Diners Club, China UnionPay**.

                                      `Guest` means hotel is authorized. In this case, sibling array `CreditCard` defines the restriction on card issuers.

                                        ##### This parameter affects whether a `pay-at-hotel room `needs guarantee. If hotel sets a `holdtime` (at `Get Hotel Detail Price` API) on the `pay-at-hotel` room to be reserved, the estimated latest arrival time finally decides whether guests need to make guarantee (typically with credit cards) for their reservations. If estimated latest arrival time is before hold time, the reservation doesn't need any guarantee. If estimated latest arrival time is at or after hold time, the reservation needs to be guaranteed with certain guarantee amount (typically with credit cards).

        This API confirms whether a selected sellable room returned by `Get Hotel Detail Price` API is still valid before booking. It will also tell you bunch of other important dynamic inforation such as most fresh prices and cancellation policy. If the selected room is still available, we will respond `AvailableForSale`. Otherwise, we will respond `NoAvailability`.

        Mind that availability status only verifies inventory, it doesn't concern price or cancellation policy. If price or cancellation policy has changed, but there's still enough inventory to book, we will also respond `AvailableForSale`. So make sure you have kindly notified guests of such changes at your pre-booking page.

        **You couldn't skip this step before reserving a sellable room. You must also use the most fresh rates and most fresh cancellation policy to make a new reservation**

                                  ##### For `pay-at-hotel` room, there's no `settlement price` at all, and it only has `retail price`. If a `pay-at-hotel` room needs guarantee, you could use total guarantee amount within the array directly. You could also calculate total guarantee amount based on parameter `GuaranteeCode` within the array.

                                  ##### If we only offer you `retail price` for `pay-in-advance` room, you could also use total guarantee amount within the array directly. When a confirmed reservation proves noshow, guarantee amount will be deducted as penalty.

                                  ##### If we offer you `settlement price` for `pay-in-advance` room, you could ONLY calculate total guarantee amount based on parameter `GuaranteeCode` within the array. When a confirmed reservation proves noshow, guarantee amount will be deducted as penalty.

If hotel sets a `holdtime` (at `Get Hotel Detail Price` API) on the `pay-at-hotel` room to be reserved, the estimated latest arrival time finally decides whether guests need to make guarantee (typically with credit cards) for their reservations. If estimated latest arrival time is before hold time, the reservation doesn't need any guarantee. If estimated latest arrival time is at or after hold time, the reservation needs to be guaranteed with certain guarantee amount (typically with credit cards).

        This API is used to generate a temporary reservation id with a sellable room which has been verified to be available via `Provision Check` API. Mind that you must submit the reservation id with `Reservation Submitting` API, otherwise our system (system automation or manual intervention) won't ask suppliers or hotels to handle the reservation at all!

        Make sure that a temporary reservation id will be submitted within 30 minutes after it's generated. The longer the time gap becomes, the larger the possibility of submission failure will be. Also note that we will delete unsubmitted reservations after 24 hours automatically.

        This API is used to submit the temporary reservation id which was generated by `Reservation Saving` API at previous stage. Mind that you must submit the reservation id with this API, otherwise our system (system automation or manual intervention) won't ask suppliers or hotels to handle the reservation at all!

        Make sure that a temporary reservation id will be submitted within 30 minutes after it's generated. The longer the time gap becomes, the larger the possibility of submission failure will be. Also note that we will delete unsubmitted reservations after 24 hours automatically.

        **Mind that a successful submission doesn't mean the reservation is confirmed!** The initial status of a successfully submitted reservation is `Process`, meaning the reservation is not confirmed, and needs to be confirmed by hotel or supplier! You could only notify your guests of final confirmation result after receiving final confirmation result from us. The next few APIs (in chapter `Reservation Confirmation`) will introduce to you how to judge whether a reservation is confirmed.

                                      It defines the meaning of sibling parameter `ResID_Value`. Here are details:

                                      1.`501` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is our reservation id. If `501` comes alone or comes with `502` alone, there's only one reservation id to identify a reservation on our end.

                                      2.`502` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is hotel confirmation number. Since hotel confirmation number help a lot for guests to check in, we suggest you provide it to your guests.

                                      3.`507` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is the new reservation id thus generated after revising original reservation. If `507` comes with `501`, `507` points to new reservation id while `501` points to original reservation id on our end.

                                      4.`509` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is the original reservation id. If `509` comes with `501`, `509` points to original reservation id while `501` points to new reservation id.

                                      ##### Note that `502`, `507` and `509` won't come alone. They will always come together with `501`.

                                      ---
                                      #### You just made one reservation. Why we might have multiple reservation ids mapped to one reservation?
                                      When you make  a reservation to us, we will generate one reservation id. If this reservation is revised, it might generate anohter reservation id which is mapped to original one. When the new reservation id is further revised, it might generate another new reservation id. This means one original reservation id might have multiple other reservation ids mapped to it on our end.

                                      #### How to handle an original reservation which has multiple reservation ids mapped to it?
                                      These resevations are actually separated reservations on our end. They are just correlated with each other. When you find an original reservation id is mapped to multiple reservation ids. Simply record those new reservations in your system for the same guest by querying `Reservation Details` API.

                                      On your end, simply take them as separated reservation ids made by the same guest. Each reservation id has its own reservation status.

                                      On our end, we might cancel original reservation id and have new reservation id confirmed.


                                      #### How frequently will `507` and `509` appear?
                                      They appear rarely. If a reservation is not modified, they won't exist. If you want to eliminate `507` and `509`permanently, request us to disable reservation modification service for your credential.

        ### What's the purpose of this API?
        As we mentioned in previous API, initial status of a successfully submitted reservation is `Process` meaning it's not confirmed yet, and needs to be further confirmed by hotel or our supplier! This API will tell you reservation status change records of all reservations after they are successfully submitted, such as `process->confirm->success` and `process->cancel`. Once you know reservation status of certain reservations have changed, you could query `Reservation Details` API to further check whether those reservations are confirmed or cancelled.

        ### How to use it more effectively?
        We suggest you build a separate service to query the API for status change records of all reservations happened within each different time period. It's also necessary to overlap each sibling time period a little bit (e.g., overlap 1 min), thus making sure you will not miss any status change record. Below is a good example:

                                      It defines the meaning of sibling parameter `ResID_Value`. Here are details:

                                      1.`501` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is our reservation id. If `501` comes alone or comes with `502` alone, there's only one reservation id to identify a reservation on our end.

                                      2.`502` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is hotel confirmation number. Since hotel confirmation number help a lot for guests to check in, we suggest you provide it to your guests.

                                      3.`507` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is the new reservation id thus generated after revising original reservation. If `507` comes with `501`, `507` points to new reservation id while `501` points to original reservation id on our end.

                                      4.`509` means sibling parameter `ResID_Value` is the original reservation id. If `509` comes with `501`, `509` points to original reservation id while `501` points to new reservation id.

                                      ##### Note that `502`, `507` and `509` won't come alone. They will always come together with `501`.

                                      #### You just made one reservation. Why we might have multiple reservation ids mapped to one reservation?
                                      When you make  a reservation to us, we will generate one reservation id. If this reservation is revised, it might generate anohter reservation id which is mapped to original one. When the new reservation id is further revised, it might generate another new reservation id. This means one original reservation id might have multiple other reservation ids mapped to it on our end.

                                      #### How to handle an original reservation which has multiple reservation ids mapped to it?
                                      These resevations are actually separated reservations on our end. They are just correlated with each other. When you find an original reservation id is mapped to multiple reservation ids. Simply record those new reservations in your system for the same guest by querying `Reservation Details` API.

                                      On your end, simply take them as separated reservation ids made by the same guest. Each reservation id has its own reservation status.

                                      On our end, we might cancel original reservation id and have new reservation id confirmed.


                                      #### How frequently will `507` and `509` appear?
                                      They appear rarely. If a reservation is not modified, they won't exist. If you want to eliminate `507` and `509`permanently, request us to disable reservation modification service for your credential.

                                      It's the unique code to identify an operation tag.

                                      1.`AllowCancel` helps identify whether the reservation could be cancelled at current time. Whether a reservation could be cancelled either free of charge or cancelled with certain penalty. `T` means it could be cancelled while `F` means it couldn't be cancelled. Deteails are listed below:
                                      + If `one-layer cancellation policy` is enabled, the operation tag helps identify whether the reservation could be cancelled free of charge or couldn't be cancelled at all.
                                      + If `multi-layer cancellation policy` is enabled and `30-Minute Unconditional Cancellation Activity` is disabled, the operation tag works with cancellation request time and cancellation policy to help you identify whether cancellation will involve certain cancellation penalty.
                                      + If both `multi-layer cancellation policy` and `30-Minute Unconditional Cancellation Activity` are enabled, the operation tag works with cancellation request time, cancellation policy and 30-minute cancellatino activity to help you identify whether the cancellation will involve certain cancellation penalty.

        This API is used to cancel a reservation. A reservation could only be cancelled when it meets either of below conditions: 1. It's still in process, not confirmed, and we are still waiting for hotel or supplier to confirm it. 2. Though it's confirmed, however its cancellation policy allows to have it cancelled either free or charge or with certain cancellation penalty.

        More importantly, cancellation attempts might fail sometimes (either confirmed at the moment of cancellation request or not allowed to cancel as per cancelllation policy). So you couldn't take it for granted that cancellation is absolutely successful just for that you made a cancellation request! The only way to judge whether cancellation is successful is to read our resposne content. Details will be introduced in description of different params.

        As we mentioned before, if a **confirmed reservation** is made on a **pay-in-advance** room and guests are verified as **NOSHOW** at or after check-out date, we might refund guests certain amount for the reservation. Refunding amount = Total price - guarantee amount. In our practice, we will refund to your virtual credit account in our financial system directly. You could only refund your guest after we refund you. If you refund guests before we refund you, you will bear all losses which might occur. Here is an example: Reservation amount is CNY 400, guarantee amount is CNY 100. The reservation was confirmed, guest didn't cancel it and didn't check in. After check-out date, we verified that guest didn't check in, so we refund CNY 300 to your virtul credit account. After receiving the refunding from us, you refund CNY 300 to your guest.

        This API will notify you refunding records of **confirmed reservations** (which are proven to be **NOSHOW**) happened  during your queried time period. Mind that it only works for reservations made on **pay-in-advance** rooms.

        This API tells you our latest night audit result of each reserved room in the complete night audit procedure for queried reservations made on **pay-at-hotel** rooms which belong to **hotels located in China**. For reservations made on pay-at-hotel rooms which belong to hotels outside of China, we don't do night audit yet!

        In theory, a complete night audit procedure will involve four parties (hotel itself or our supplier, we as a supplier of yours, yourself, your guests) and involve multiple night audit stages for a reservation. This leads to the complexity of a complete night audit procedure. To simply the work, most of our affiliate partners chooe to use our night audit result directly. We also suggest you follow this way.
