## 1. Become a partner
You need to become our partner in order to develop our APIs. If you haven't done so, apply to our partnership manager.

## 2. Get credentials & configure for authentication
Once you become our partner, we will assign a test credential and production credential to you. A complete credential consists of one Alliance ID, one Site ID and one corresponding API key. 

You should configure test credential into your test environment and production credential into your production environment.A complete credential is used for authentication purpose which is introduced in chapter [Authentication](#authentication).

## 3. Begin testing with test credential
You must start testing with test credential at our test environment when you are not very familiar with our modular APIs. Once you finish the development in our test environment, place test bookings to verify you have integrated well.

## 4. Deploy to production environment
If testing goes well in our test environment, you should further deploy to your production environment and config production environment as well. Before going live, we will provide you a testing hotel id for pre-sale testing.

## 5. Request site review
Once youâ€™re satisfied with your integration and have confirmed you have met requirements raised in chapter [Launch Requirements](#launch), ask your account manager for site review. After you get an approval from us, go live for sale.
