### 1. Become our affiliate partner
---
You will need to become our affiliate partner in order to integrate with our APIs. If you haven't done it, talk with your Trip.com partnership manager.

### 2. Get credentials & configure for authentication
---
After you become our affiliate partner, we will assign one pair of test credential and one pair of live credential for you. The test credential helps you access Trip.com test environment while the live credential could only be used for live environment. Mind that a complete pair of credential includes Alliance ID, Site ID, Proxy Key and Extra Identity Number. If you didn't receive a complete pair of credential, ask your Trip.com partnership manager to help provide. For authentication, it will be introduced in chapter [Authentication](#authentication).

### 3. Develop with test credential in test environment
---
When you start the development, you are not familiar with our APIs yet. So you could only finish the development and do regular debugging with test credential in our test environment. This helps to minimize all possible risks after deploying to live environment. Once you notify your Trip.com product manager to help review the integration in test environment, we will work with you to do QA check. If some requirements are not met, we might request you to do further optimization. Requirements are specified in chapter [Launch Requirements](#Launch-Requirements)

### 4. Deploy your code scripts to your live environment
---
Once we have confirmed that you have passed the verification in test environment, we will notify you to make deployment in your live environment. However, it's not finished yet. You gotta do internal recheck and make sure it works fine. Once you become satisfied with it, notify us to do site review.

### 5. Request site review and finilize the time to go for sale
---
At site-review stage, we will provide you new testing cases using specified hotels in live environment. You need to finish these test cases first. Then we help do the QA check again. If we confirm that you have passed the pre-launch verification, notify your Trip.com partnership manager and Trip.com product manager your exact datetime to go live for sale. Mind that we might request you to do further optimization at site-review stage. So try your best to optimize the project before you notify us to do the QA check. This helps save time and improve efficiency for both teams.
